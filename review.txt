Four times today it was using the microphone in the background even though the microphone permissions are set to off. What's it listening to???Great maps for Korea. Always works greatCompared to GOOG earth/appleüçé map/Open street maps/Naver maps/BIDU maps, was native HanJa/HanGul written scrips for understanding the capitilist stock exchange and casinosI have a note 9 and although this app was working fine all of a sudden it doesnt show the map properly.

Full ReviewMaps are informative but the bus alarms and the arrival for the bus has been very inaccurate. I have missed my bus stops few times because of it's false alarm. Hope a fix in the future.This app is extremely useful,and accurate! Downside: still hard to find places with an american name and it doesn't give you a parking search like waze does. Still my first choice when driving!I think everything is good. But, recently, the app alarm has started getting off automatically after some time when I set it. Could you help me with this? From the app itself I could not reach anyone ...there is like ..Contact us...When I click on it...the app says ....We are sorry. An error occured...
Full ReviewAccurate routing and easy to find destination. However, the recent update has made the link to kakaonavi broken. Kakaonavi link is needed for use with Android Auto in Korea! Please help to fix ASAP!Great app, but how the heck do I edit my work and home?? I tried to search for it everywhere but once it is set, you cannot u change it. What if I move? What if I get new job? There is literally ZERO information on how to do this!Great app to get places. Easy map navigation and its in a language I can understand well.So easy to use with minimum Korean needed. I have never gotten lost using it and the subway information is accurateI LIKE THIS APP BECAUSE IT HAS ENGLISH SPEAKING AND ENGLISH DIRECTION TRANSLATED...U CANT GET LOST FROM.THIS..THANK YOU FOR U GUYS IT HELPS ME A LOT...I USE THIS FOR NAViGATION AND SEARCHING PLACES (TOURIST PLACES) HELPS A LOTüòçüòçüòç Easy to useüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèForeigner friendly app Better than Naver map app if u don't speak KoreanTreats your personal info like 'public' info, sharing your home address, work address, favorite places...

But need more upgrade specially in search box...its very specific typo to be able to understand by this app..Accurate and easyReally useful if you're in KoreaI love this app. It's UI is cleaner and more intuitive than the competition. It connects well to other apps. I also applaud the English language support which is great for tourists and expats. **But please include a faster toggle between English and Korean. Maybe in the maps settings filters. It's t...
Full ReviewI absolutely love the app. I find it more intuitive than Google maps and being able to see the buses move on the map in real time is amazing. I wish Kakao maps covered other countries! Some parts of the app (for example the notices) are still entirely in Korean, which is the only reason I didn't giv...
Full ReviewVery helpful map in Korea . I want to give it 5 stars , but i gives 4 , because I'm a Motorcycle Rider , this app send me to Highways a lot . Which is not good at all . In korean law , motorcycle riders can't go in highways . I've already setup my settings on app that i have motorcycle , but still s...
Full ReviewIt would have been very hard visiting Seoul without this app. Nice job! One suggestion though (from a tourist point of view) : sometimes is not easy to find locations by name because some places only have their Korean name. It would be great if that could be improved so a location can be found by se...
Full ReviewThis app is really helpful! (thanks for the creator of this app) for all of the foreign people who will visit south korea, but their's one thing problem in this app, although its translated in english but the information of bus/subway is not translated in english this is the most important , i reall...
Full ReviewProbably, the best navigation guide in South Korea. It would be even more handy if people in charge add some minor features. For example, I am in Jongno-gu, Seoul right now and after a while I need a pharmacy in Gangnam-gu. In such cases, it would be better if the app also shows 'pharmacy', 'ATM', '...
Full ReviewNeeds a little bit more English support. And above all else, it needs to stop searching for things on the opposite side of Korea. If I'm looking for EMarts in Busan, I don't want the map to jump to Pyeongyang. Would be nice if intercity and express buses had their times listed. Everything else is fa...
Full ReviewFavorite Map Service in Korea. I like that I'm able to see/find bus stops and get pretty accurate times of the arrival. I also like that I can call Kakao Taxi through this app. One thing I don't like is that I'm unable to search for locations in English on my app, unless it's saved. My app is in Eng...
Full ReviewWorks well if you know Korean but English translation and English recognition still needs lots of work. The navigation is very weak and inaccurate when indicating multiple floors or levels. Needs much better navigation guidance notification. Completely lacking accurate turn by turn navigation guidan...
Full ReviewGenerally a Google map user, but since Google map doesn't work well in Korea, I've downloaded both Naver maps and Kakao maps to aid my trip in Seoul, Incheon and Suwon. I found that Kakao map is the best and most accurate in general. However when following calculated routes it can get a bit confusin...
Full ReviewUsed this on my trip to korea. It was the first time I used the subways and busses there, but it was very convenient with this app. It even alerts you when it is time to get off and starts to remind from one station before your destination arrives. Thanks to this app i got to conveniently use the bu...
Full ReviewNo navigation cues, all key information is in Korean. It doesn't even understand an address if it's in English. Mostly had no help from the app when I used this for biking and had to rely on locals pointing me in the right direction. Would also help if the app actually tells me my present location a...
Full ReviewIt's pretty amazing that this day in age 2019 Google Maps is still largely disfunctional in South Korea. Talk about a country that is so clueless about tourism and wonders why people still choose Japan first. KakaoMaps is sadly your best alternative but not surprising it's still no match for the qua...
Full ReviewEven though I'm not Korean and cannot read Korean, I'm able to navigate really well using this app. It tells me when to get on the bus and sends me reminders when my stop is coming. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because I for me, having an English would make it even simpler to use.Awesome bicycle map!!! This map gives you gradient info along your planned route. Very handy for cyclists.I like the app! Unfortunately despite having the settings in English, the turn by turn instructions are all in Korean. So i can't read which road to turn on to. I hope that can be fixed!I've compared Waze to Kakao maps. Kakao Maps has better routes, and better ETAs by far. The only reason it's not five star, is because a lot of English searching does not work for the Korean maps, when the same searches, in English, work on Waze & Google Maps.It's a real mess with a very partial english translation. It's slow, doesn't give much information and there is a lot of place that it doesn't find. Even so, it's stil' better than Line map (Which wasn't hard ...)As a foreigner this app is extremely helpful. I use it for driving navigation, bus and subway routes and general location services. It has an English setting so there is no worry about understanding (or misunderstanding) Korean!Mixed feelings about this app. I have set the language to English, but when I get the travelling instructions it shows the names in Korean, which doesn't help with station names or direction of transport. I have thus not used it. It however shows options when Google maps says it can't.Wow, the perfect app for travelling in South Korea! Saves a lot of time and hustle. The best feature is the alert feature which will tell you when to go off the bus as you go, this way you know both how much time you have and how much stations are left to go.Navigation directions rendered and station names are correct. However, the app is not friendly for an individual who cannot read korean. I would suggest using other Apps that provide English context to navigate in Seoul for the moment until the language capability for this App is enhanced.It's just OK. I can change the language to English on the app but it only changes the map itself. Most of everything else with notifications, directions, etc. is still in Korean.Liars! I denied permission to access my camera, mic and storage. Description says "You can still use the service even if you don't give the above permissions." When I try to navigate, app won't work unless I grant permission. Uninstalled.recommended as Most useful for non korean speakers... but when it provides transport options. the name of the train/metro stations are in Korean! so how is that Useful and user friendly to non korean speakers!? ü§îüòëüôÑ Still need to Improve for sure...extremely useful. able to search and read in English. complete bus to subway routes. Travel time estimates sometimes off. Biking travel times are for speed bikes, not for hybrids or city bikes.App was great until the latest Android update where it now the only location permissions you can select for it are to disable or only allow while the app is running which breaks the feature which tracks your ride while on public transportation.Super easy to use! It can help you find your way even amongst the tiny little streets, and points out your precise location even if you are on a small footpath in the forest like surrounding :) Well done KakaoMap!Using this app is very convenient. It's still hard to find certain stores, places, restaurants using English but it improved a lot compare to last year though. And i love the feature of finding public restrooms around you (type in "toilet")üòÅIt the best app to use only in korea .. really help a lot for travel alone or backpaker, All so there a few thing to update such as shopping name, language & some buses that need to inprove. Please reupdate the language for bahasa some part of it are wrong & have a different meaningWhile the menu is in English, everything else is ONLY Korean: Location names, what kind of train to take, how to walk etc. Completely useless if you can't read Korean, which is shocking as a tourist.The favorites folder option is one of my favorite features of this app. It's also great that the different route options also allow you to see the cost of the commute depending on the route you choose to go with.I dont know whats wrong with this app. Always shows wrong my current location, so always get wrong routes. I dont get it. How come the reviews are 4.5?Great. Essential if you live in Korea as google maps doesn't work.Really like the transit alert (alarm) function. It's only working for intra-city now. I hope to see it available for inter-city too.Good, but really want addresses shown in Korean too. If I use this to show a Korean or use car GPS I need to see the ÌïúÍµ¥ version too. Keep it up!Useful and easy to navigate. My problem is some exit numbers are not shown. I still used this even after my trip to bookmark places in Korea.Good app. Only bad thing is when it comes to navigation, the train station names are not in english.I love it. it can work offline. This is better than Google map because it has better details of Seoul.Great, but the English translation is not good. Many things not translated to English. Otherwise great.Very good app, you can find things by typing in English. Will work perferct with other assistant apps like Kakao subway, kakao bus an kakao taxiUsed this cos my google maps apps wasnt smooth at all and this provided more information if you are travelling from place to place while still providing both korean and english namesThis app is perfect when you need to call a taxi within Korea. The taxi will come straight to you and brought you write to your destinationTalks too much, really much. this app really like a non-stop talky device, install it and you will start hating your phone)) soo stupid like it can say 10 times take leftI love KakaoMaps. I can save my favourites and routes. It is very convenient when planning itinerary and travelling in korea.=)Thanks kakao map creator. Without it , it is so hard to go somewhere. I suggest people who are in korea to use this mapPlease add offline functionality, like Gmap, so users can download data ahead of time. Not everyone has unlimited data plan.really great app for cycling around korea. elevation, exact listings of certification centers, etc. are all really great. thanks.Its accurate and detailed. But i have one problem . It would be good if they have another one in English .Using English option but when navigating using public transport, the subway station names are shown in Korean.Definitely No. 1 navigation app in Korea. Easy to use and informs lots of useful transportaion information, eapecially a public transportation.Very useful and accurate tool to roam in seoul! English option will grant a 5stars rating as I'm convinced every tourist should use this app to get along in S. Korea thx kakaoCan bookmark places. but a little not user friendly when you are trying to navigate when drivingThe app speaks English. We drived Gyungju and Busan with this apps. So helpful as Google map doesn't quite right in korea.Have been using since middle 2017 year, and so far recommending to a lot of friends! Very nice app! Like your every Kakao AppüôÇCan't even find the place of interest. Using the app to show the taxi driver an address and the taxi driver can't even understand where the place is located. Extremely terrible app.Best app for location search and navigation. I wish it could also collaborate with related companies like other competitors do so as to provide mutual benefits.Convinient to use, the name of places is visible unlike google map. This map is knowledgeable, coz I learn how to use transportion aloneüòäPar excellence. Kakao map is a new era of innovative applications. I have only words of my praise of this map. It has changed my life.I gave it 4 cause some of the places i can't search it in english. Otherwise it's all perfect.Bus navigation such as bus stop is still only in Korean. Any additional setting required to have English language?The first problem of thid app are either unable to use without any internet connection or do not offer any offline mode . I do not think developer would thought about thatEasy to use. Most of the time is accurate, but sometimes some information is not updated.sending spam plus message after uninstall. even though I leave the chatting room, it keeps sending messages.Great app for navigation, especially for us who don't read and write KoreanGood application, just need metro stops in the latin alphabet and many locations are missingI didn't see like this very useful app before in any country But In Korea. I love it. It helps me go to any place of Korea. Thanks a ton to the creators of this appIf you learn to read Korean, this app will get you anywhere in the country. Works great all over Korea, even small unpopulated islands!! Great app!The timings and train schedule information is wrong. Idk how many times I had to sabotage my schedule putting my trust in the appMap is in English, good when you use in Korea. However, in your app it suggests to give feedback and it says, "your feedback is invaluable to us". Hoping you meant valuable:D please update it.Please let desktop version to have english on map like mobile version, it would be easier to use.Best map naivigator for Seoul, Korea. Translate to English easily.The cell I really loud this application home always helps me to find the easiest wayGreat help to foreigners to find and navigate places accurately.Easiest map for traveller, you can bookmark your place and list it in your page.Super helpful aps for traveler to korea.

Full Reviewabsolutely terrible these people think they are so damn Superior would be nice if it has some English speaking also directionsIf you live south korea, so definitely recommends for you.Would be nice if the directions were translated too. When using bus/subway/walking steps, have to keep flipping between the map to see what to actually do. Even when using a language other than Korean, would be good to have a way to still show the original Korean text next to the romanized names...

I have to constantly update my location myself.Daum Maps *was* my favorite map app for Korea for years; Kakao Map is garbage. The UI has changed for the worse, and the map isn't correctly responsive to two-finger manipulations. What a disappointment. Guess I'll have to give Naver Maps another try.Several of my favorite travel apps have changed over to being Kako versions. My subway app took me only a few minutes to figure out. Probably because of the English support it had. When i first started using Daum it had no English. But then it started to add more and more support. Its still my go-to...

Hate it!!!!Really effed up this app. DAUM was thes best and sooo easy.. way to go kakao will be moving on.Much preferred the less garish styling of Daum Maps. Also hate the shady use of permissions, I gave it location permissions to see what it would do with them, and lo and behold, it used GPS regularly when not using the app. Sad to see that it has no English support either, I don't need it personally...

It's too much like Google map, though...This is a good app if you can read Korean. I like the color system that it uses for the trains and subway stops. It's helpful when pairing it with Google maps for readers of English, and for readers of Korean. It has a good interface and is nice to use.As a foreigner living in korea, this update makes it harder for me to use without the small pieces of english that daum used to have.

ÌôîÏù¥ÌåÖÏûÖÎãàÎã§~Why?Not badDaum Maps was my go-to app for many many years in Seoul. It had a reasonable amount of English and was very easy to use. This update from Kakao removed absolutely all English. Unless you are fully fluent in Korean, I would avoid this app like the plague.Really dislike the new Kakao map. Even thought I can't understand Korean, I could still use the old Daum map with the "my location" and selecting where I want to go on the map. The colors are also too bright and annoying. Please make the old version available again.Awesome update. So much better than the previous version. I like it how they try to follow the material design trend. The animation seems to be a bit heavy, though. Anyway, in my opinion, the best map app you can find in Korea.The old one worked and looked so much better. From 5/5 to 2/5. I dont want to zoom so far in to see subway stations and exit numbers. It still is better thsn Naver Map.The new face lift looks great. The integration with KakaoTalk and other social media aspects make this a great update. If you aren't afraid of change then this is for you! Complete removal of English was a bit of a downer but hey if you already know the ins and outs of general map apps then it shou...

Full ReviewI had Daum Maps on my phone, and it was a great app. Why change it and replace it with that terrible thing? No language options, an indecipherable menu? Why replace something good with something absolutely crappy? I am uninstalling this.This app sucks! Here's why. Almost every time I choose a route, I see the projected cost for tolls. Yet every time it re-routes me, without asking first, and I pay 3 times more than anticipated. I can't even count how much money this dumb app has cost me. DON'T RE-ROUTE WOTHOUT MY PERMISSION!!!Kk maps find routes with public transport, with big 'gaps' (chunks of the route that isnt covered by any public transport, like 10km or any distance). However doest tell you about the gaps. How am I suppose to cover gaps? One has to walk/bike/take taxi?? Tell me!! Daum maps didnt have such flaws....Used this map during my first trip to Seoul. I really like the real-time bus information. Makes moving around more easier and accurate.Have now several times ended up going to somewhere that is closed down. It s outdated.There is no better navigation in the world. It has it all. If you live in Korea and planning get it.Dump it same where. Every thing in Chinese. No where English is used translated!I wonder if there is an option to just keep iy into english? Mine (except for the tabs) are all in Korean. I van read Hangeul but understand just a little.Great that the a itself is in english, but not good that the directions are all in Korean. I was just looking at the dot on the map to hope I was moving in the right direction.App caused a catastrophic failure of my phone while uninstalling it, what a joke.Good app. Very useful and quite accurate. There is definitely room for improvement but on the whole it served its purpose to help us find our way in Seoul and Busan.Î≤ÑÏä§Ïñ¥Ìîå ÏßÄÎèÑÏï± ÏãπÎã§ Ï†ïÎ¶¨ÌïòÍ≥† Ïπ¥Ïπ¥Ïò§ÎßµÎßå ÍπîÎ©¥Îê® ÏßÑÏßú Ìé∏ÌïòÎã§ ÌäπÌûà Î≤ÑÏä§ Î™áÏ¥àÌõÑ ÎèÑÏ∞©ÏóêÏÑú ÏßÄÎ¶ΩÎãàÎã§Ïã§ÏãúÍ∞Ñ ÍµêÌÜµÎ∞òÏòÅÏùÑ Ï†ÑÌòÄÏïàÌï®.
