Four times today it was using the microphone in the background even though the microphone permissions are set to off. What's it listening to???Great maps for Korea. Always works greatCompared to GOOG earth/apple🍎 map/Open street maps/Naver maps/BIDU maps, was native HanJa/HanGul written scrips for understanding the capitilist stock exchange and casinosI have a note 9 and although this app was working fine all of a sudden it doesnt show the map properly. It will either be grayed out or be very zoomed out(even if you zoom in it doesnt give detailed map markers or show roads etc). It still locates me and gives me the directions to go places if i typ...
Full ReviewMaps are informative but the bus alarms and the arrival for the bus has been very inaccurate. I have missed my bus stops few times because of it's false alarm. Hope a fix in the future.This app is extremely useful,and accurate! Downside: still hard to find places with an american name and it doesn't give you a parking search like waze does. Still my first choice when driving!I think everything is good. But, recently, the app alarm has started getting off automatically after some time when I set it. Could you help me with this? From the app itself I could not reach anyone ...there is like ..Contact us...When I click on it...the app says ....We are sorry. An error occured...
Full ReviewAccurate routing and easy to find destination. However, the recent update has made the link to kakaonavi broken. Kakaonavi link is needed for use with Android Auto in Korea! Please help to fix ASAP!Great app, but how the heck do I edit my work and home?? I tried to search for it everywhere but once it is set, you cannot u change it. What if I move? What if I get new job? There is literally ZERO information on how to do this!Great app to get places. Easy map navigation and its in a language I can understand well.So easy to use with minimum Korean needed. I have never gotten lost using it and the subway information is accurateI LIKE THIS APP BECAUSE IT HAS ENGLISH SPEAKING AND ENGLISH DIRECTION TRANSLATED...U CANT GET LOST FROM.THIS..THANK YOU FOR U GUYS IT HELPS ME A LOT...I USE THIS FOR NAViGATION AND SEARCHING PLACES (TOURIST PLACES) HELPS A LOT😍😍😍 Easy to use👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏Foreigner friendly app Better than Naver map app if u don't speak KoreanTreats your personal info like 'public' info, sharing your home address, work address, favorite places... Etc.One of the best app ...even better than Google maps..easy find , but want to update around area picturesUseful for practically all Korean transport needs.Could add alert when near destinationNot good enough for a foreigner at leastGood apps!! But need more upgrade specially in search box...its very specific typo to be able to understand by this app..Accurate and easyReally useful if you're in KoreaI love this app. It's UI is cleaner and more intuitive than the competition. It connects well to other apps. I also applaud the English language support which is great for tourists and expats. **But please include a faster toggle between English and Korean. Maybe in the maps settings filters. It's t...
Full ReviewI absolutely love the app. I find it more intuitive than Google maps and being able to see the buses move on the map in real time is amazing. I wish Kakao maps covered other countries! Some parts of the app (for example the notices) are still entirely in Korean, which is the only reason I didn't giv...
Full ReviewVery helpful map in Korea . I want to give it 5 stars , but i gives 4 , because I'm a Motorcycle Rider , this app send me to Highways a lot . Which is not good at all . In korean law , motorcycle riders can't go in highways . I've already setup my settings on app that i have motorcycle , but still s...
Full ReviewIt would have been very hard visiting Seoul without this app. Nice job! One suggestion though (from a tourist point of view) : sometimes is not easy to find locations by name because some places only have their Korean name. It would be great if that could be improved so a location can be found by se...
Full ReviewThis app is really helpful! (thanks for the creator of this app) for all of the foreign people who will visit south korea, but their's one thing problem in this app, although its translated in english but the information of bus/subway is not translated in english this is the most important , i reall...
Full ReviewProbably, the best navigation guide in South Korea. It would be even more handy if people in charge add some minor features. For example, I am in Jongno-gu, Seoul right now and after a while I need a pharmacy in Gangnam-gu. In such cases, it would be better if the app also shows 'pharmacy', 'ATM', '...
Full ReviewNeeds a little bit more English support. And above all else, it needs to stop searching for things on the opposite side of Korea. If I'm looking for EMarts in Busan, I don't want the map to jump to Pyeongyang. Would be nice if intercity and express buses had their times listed. Everything else is fa...
Full ReviewFavorite Map Service in Korea. I like that I'm able to see/find bus stops and get pretty accurate times of the arrival. I also like that I can call Kakao Taxi through this app. One thing I don't like is that I'm unable to search for locations in English on my app, unless it's saved. My app is in Eng...
Full ReviewWorks well if you know Korean but English translation and English recognition still needs lots of work. The navigation is very weak and inaccurate when indicating multiple floors or levels. Needs much better navigation guidance notification. Completely lacking accurate turn by turn navigation guidan...
Full ReviewGenerally a Google map user, but since Google map doesn't work well in Korea, I've downloaded both Naver maps and Kakao maps to aid my trip in Seoul, Incheon and Suwon. I found that Kakao map is the best and most accurate in general. However when following calculated routes it can get a bit confusin...
Full ReviewUsed this on my trip to korea. It was the first time I used the subways and busses there, but it was very convenient with this app. It even alerts you when it is time to get off and starts to remind from one station before your destination arrives. Thanks to this app i got to conveniently use the bu...
Full ReviewNo navigation cues, all key information is in Korean. It doesn't even understand an address if it's in English. Mostly had no help from the app when I used this for biking and had to rely on locals pointing me in the right direction. Would also help if the app actually tells me my present location a...
Full ReviewIt's pretty amazing that this day in age 2019 Google Maps is still largely disfunctional in South Korea. Talk about a country that is so clueless about tourism and wonders why people still choose Japan first. KakaoMaps is sadly your best alternative but not surprising it's still no match for the qua...
Full ReviewEven though I'm not Korean and cannot read Korean, I'm able to navigate really well using this app. It tells me when to get on the bus and sends me reminders when my stop is coming. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because I for me, having an English would make it even simpler to use.Awesome bicycle map!!! This map gives you gradient info along your planned route. Very handy for cyclists.I like the app! Unfortunately despite having the settings in English, the turn by turn instructions are all in Korean. So i can't read which road to turn on to. I hope that can be fixed!I've compared Waze to Kakao maps. Kakao Maps has better routes, and better ETAs by far. The only reason it's not five star, is because a lot of English searching does not work for the Korean maps, when the same searches, in English, work on Waze & Google Maps.It's a real mess with a very partial english translation. It's slow, doesn't give much information and there is a lot of place that it doesn't find. Even so, it's stil' better than Line map (Which wasn't hard ...)As a foreigner this app is extremely helpful. I use it for driving navigation, bus and subway routes and general location services. It has an English setting so there is no worry about understanding (or misunderstanding) Korean!Mixed feelings about this app. I have set the language to English, but when I get the travelling instructions it shows the names in Korean, which doesn't help with station names or direction of transport. I have thus not used it. It however shows options when Google maps says it can't.Wow, the perfect app for travelling in South Korea! Saves a lot of time and hustle. The best feature is the alert feature which will tell you when to go off the bus as you go, this way you know both how much time you have and how much stations are left to go.Navigation directions rendered and station names are correct. However, the app is not friendly for an individual who cannot read korean. I would suggest using other Apps that provide English context to navigate in Seoul for the moment until the language capability for this App is enhanced.It's just OK. I can change the language to English on the app but it only changes the map itself. Most of everything else with notifications, directions, etc. is still in Korean.Liars! I denied permission to access my camera, mic and storage. Description says "You can still use the service even if you don't give the above permissions." When I try to navigate, app won't work unless I grant permission. Uninstalled.recommended as Most useful for non korean speakers... but when it provides transport options. the name of the train/metro stations are in Korean! so how is that Useful and user friendly to non korean speakers!? 🤔😑🙄 Still need to Improve for sure...extremely useful. able to search and read in English. complete bus to subway routes. Travel time estimates sometimes off. Biking travel times are for speed bikes, not for hybrids or city bikes.App was great until the latest Android update where it now the only location permissions you can select for it are to disable or only allow while the app is running which breaks the feature which tracks your ride while on public transportation.Super easy to use! It can help you find your way even amongst the tiny little streets, and points out your precise location even if you are on a small footpath in the forest like surrounding :) Well done KakaoMap!Using this app is very convenient. It's still hard to find certain stores, places, restaurants using English but it improved a lot compare to last year though. And i love the feature of finding public restrooms around you (type in "toilet")😁It the best app to use only in korea .. really help a lot for travel alone or backpaker, All so there a few thing to update such as shopping name, language & some buses that need to inprove. Please reupdate the language for bahasa some part of it are wrong & have a different meaningWhile the menu is in English, everything else is ONLY Korean: Location names, what kind of train to take, how to walk etc. Completely useless if you can't read Korean, which is shocking as a tourist.The favorites folder option is one of my favorite features of this app. It's also great that the different route options also allow you to see the cost of the commute depending on the route you choose to go with.I dont know whats wrong with this app. Always shows wrong my current location, so always get wrong routes. I dont get it. How come the reviews are 4.5?Great. Essential if you live in Korea as google maps doesn't work.Really like the transit alert (alarm) function. It's only working for intra-city now. I hope to see it available for inter-city too.Good, but really want addresses shown in Korean too. If I use this to show a Korean or use car GPS I need to see the 한굴 version too. Keep it up!Useful and easy to navigate. My problem is some exit numbers are not shown. I still used this even after my trip to bookmark places in Korea.Good app. Only bad thing is when it comes to navigation, the train station names are not in english.I love it. it can work offline. This is better than Google map because it has better details of Seoul.Great, but the English translation is not good. Many things not translated to English. Otherwise great.Very good app, you can find things by typing in English. Will work perferct with other assistant apps like Kakao subway, kakao bus an kakao taxiUsed this cos my google maps apps wasnt smooth at all and this provided more information if you are travelling from place to place while still providing both korean and english namesThis app is perfect when you need to call a taxi within Korea. The taxi will come straight to you and brought you write to your destinationTalks too much, really much. this app really like a non-stop talky device, install it and you will start hating your phone)) soo stupid like it can say 10 times take leftI love KakaoMaps. I can save my favourites and routes. It is very convenient when planning itinerary and travelling in korea.=)Thanks kakao map creator. Without it , it is so hard to go somewhere. I suggest people who are in korea to use this mapPlease add offline functionality, like Gmap, so users can download data ahead of time. Not everyone has unlimited data plan.really great app for cycling around korea. elevation, exact listings of certification centers, etc. are all really great. thanks.Its accurate and detailed. But i have one problem . It would be good if they have another one in English .Using English option but when navigating using public transport, the subway station names are shown in Korean.Definitely No. 1 navigation app in Korea. Easy to use and informs lots of useful transportaion information, eapecially a public transportation.Very useful and accurate tool to roam in seoul! English option will grant a 5stars rating as I'm convinced every tourist should use this app to get along in S. Korea thx kakaoCan bookmark places. but a little not user friendly when you are trying to navigate when drivingThe app speaks English. We drived Gyungju and Busan with this apps. So helpful as Google map doesn't quite right in korea.Have been using since middle 2017 year, and so far recommending to a lot of friends! Very nice app! Like your every Kakao App🙂Can't even find the place of interest. Using the app to show the taxi driver an address and the taxi driver can't even understand where the place is located. Extremely terrible app.Best app for location search and navigation. I wish it could also collaborate with related companies like other competitors do so as to provide mutual benefits.Convinient to use, the name of places is visible unlike google map. This map is knowledgeable, coz I learn how to use transportion alone😊Par excellence. Kakao map is a new era of innovative applications. I have only words of my praise of this map. It has changed my life.I gave it 4 cause some of the places i can't search it in english. Otherwise it's all perfect.Bus navigation such as bus stop is still only in Korean. Any additional setting required to have English language?The first problem of thid app are either unable to use without any internet connection or do not offer any offline mode . I do not think developer would thought about thatEasy to use. Most of the time is accurate, but sometimes some information is not updated.sending spam plus message after uninstall. even though I leave the chatting room, it keeps sending messages.Great app for navigation, especially for us who don't read and write KoreanGood application, just need metro stops in the latin alphabet and many locations are missingI didn't see like this very useful app before in any country But In Korea. I love it. It helps me go to any place of Korea. Thanks a ton to the creators of this appIf you learn to read Korean, this app will get you anywhere in the country. Works great all over Korea, even small unpopulated islands!! Great app!The timings and train schedule information is wrong. Idk how many times I had to sabotage my schedule putting my trust in the appMap is in English, good when you use in Korea. However, in your app it suggests to give feedback and it says, "your feedback is invaluable to us". Hoping you meant valuable:D please update it.Please let desktop version to have english on map like mobile version, it would be easier to use.Best map naivigator for Seoul, Korea. Translate to English easily.The cell I really loud this application home always helps me to find the easiest wayGreat help to foreigners to find and navigate places accurately.Easiest map for traveller, you can bookmark your place and list it in your page.Super helpful aps for traveler to korea. Even for anyone that doesnt know korean language at allI like that I can use either Korean or English to find things!With Google maps pretty much useless in Korea, this app is my best friend and life saver!!!업데이트하고 나서 제가 저장한 500개 가고 싶은 곳은 다 삭제되어버렸다. 고쳐 주세요. After updating the app it deleted all of the 500 locations I had saved.Bike lane routes are easy to navigate with high accuracy.This app does not show tunnels, so I sometimes make mistakes when I decide routes.Very useful. If you have this app, you won't need anything else to navigate SK.5 star for the accuracy and easy to use app..google map cannot use in koreaEasy to use map in Korea and latest street view photos...

It was also useful with cabs as some cab drivers didn't know my destination, but could follow my map and get me where I was going. ...
Full Reviewabsolutely terrible these people think they are so damn Superior would be nice if it has some English speaking also directionsIf you live south korea, so definitely recommends for you.Would be nice if the directions were translated too. When using bus/subway/walking steps, have to keep flipping between the map to see what to actually do. Even when using a language other than Korean, would be good to have a way to still show the original Korean text next to the romanized names...

Would be good if it had other languages such as English버스 노선 정보가 엉망. 이거 믿고 버스 탔다가 엄청 고생했음.Very good....getting better and better.All things are fine but there's no offline saving option.I like this map a lot, especially for finding bus routes, but the recent update makes it difficult to use. Before places had their names on the map, now it's just addresses. The new colours also makes it difficult to read the map.i do not want limit the number of favorites -star marks, limited only 200 now. Please do not limit that amout.. i need to mark what i have to go in whole regionHow can you change the language into english? My phone's OS language is already set into english. Why isn't it changing?It is a good app thumbs up...but why is it its not working on my samsung galaxy grandWith EVERY UPDATE the account information got reset and I have to manually login again!When the Subway app isn't enough for navigation and you need bus or walking directions, this is the app to use. This is what Google Maps should have been for Korea. My only complaint is that sometimes it can't find a place if you search it in English.업종과 전화번호가 제대로 등록되어있는곳이 거의 없음English want2 thumbs up!Good목적지를 지도에서 선택할 수 없는데 나만 그런 건가요?NiceVery poor loading of map - or over usage/need of data just to display map. Refresh rate is poor as well. Almost unusable because the map lags/refresh is so slow. Needs much much performance improvement. It can't be this bad.The app is awesome srsly.

Awesome :)I'm writing a note to share my experience about Korean trip and guide my friend to use the application for searching places as well as moving in the cities. Thanks team for English version, it's great!It would be very useful for tourists if at least the menus would be in English, especially with Google maps being useless in SK. Edit on 08/02/17 Menus and settings are now in English, I've updated my rating.It would be more better if the app can search via English and translate the address from English to korea language. The map Street view photos at Busan is not updated (2014)언어를 수동으로 바꾸지는 못하나요? 폰은 영어로 했는데 지도는 한글이 더 익숙해서요...대박 !! ㅋㅋ Seriously this app is wonderful?! It's so much more useful than google and the English option is absolutely helpful for a beginning Korean speaker like me! Thank you!Good app. Will KakaoNavi be updated with an English language voice?The best mapGoodEnglish version pleaseNot in EnglishAlso, no English whatsoever. Used to have more English, but the developers took it out. Makes it a lot harder for tourists now. The old look was way easier and much more intuitive to navigate.before on daum map, 양재역 to 오리역 route search results included 3호선+분당선 options as well as 신분당선+분당선, allowing users to compare times and prices and see if it's worth it to pay the extra 신분당선 fare to save seven minutes. but now, on the kakao map, all the 양재역 to 오리역 results involve 신분당선. also there is an...

Full ReviewStill doesn't work after uninstalling and reinstalling the app! Always crashes after opening!!이 앱 때문에 항상 약속 시간에 늦었다. 도대체 열차시간에 대해서 엉터리 정보를 주는 이유가 무엇인가? 이 앱을 사용하지 말아야 할 이유는 시간이 엉터리기 때문이다. 부분적으로 맞는 것도 있는데, 그래서 약속시간을 자꾸 어기게 만든다. 시간이 다 안 맞았다면 이정도로 화나지는 않았을 것이다.베타판 내놓지말고 제대로 된 지도를 내놓읍시다 이게 뭡니까예전 거 쓰고 싶어요.이걸 새버전이라고 내놓다니...왜 더 못해졌는지Fast내위치랑 정류장겹치면 클릭도안되고 검색했을때 지도가 바로 안보임ㅋㅋ 왜 업뎃을해서 더 후져지냐Daum map was the best map application, better than Naver and Google.

This app is just horrible, its super hard to have anything done and there is still no multi-language support? Even third-world countries make apps that support at least engli...
Full ReviewComplete change of UI for no apparent reason, less intuitive, complete removal of any english. You would think that with an english name and description in english that this app would be somewhat accessible to english speakers, but no.Worst than naver map. Daum map was much more efficient and responsive. I hate this app then ever.미세먼지 표시는 어디로... 현재지역만 글씨로 나오는건 다른 날씨프로그램으로도 충분하구요.. 다음맵일때는 레이어 표시로 전국 확인이 가능했는데..Lost the function that I need. Will be uninstalled.Daum maps was betterGoodI hope the developers read the new reviews and take the advice to go back to the old app. What happened to the blue arrow? The red dot never shows me the direction I'm facing. Also, the app doesn't update my location while driving or walking. I have to constantly update my location myself.Daum Maps *was* my favorite map app for Korea for years; Kakao Map is garbage. The UI has changed for the worse, and the map isn't correctly responsive to two-finger manipulations. What a disappointment. Guess I'll have to give Naver Maps another try.Several of my favorite travel apps have changed over to being Kako versions. My subway app took me only a few minutes to figure out. Probably because of the English support it had. When i first started using Daum it had no English. But then it started to add more and more support. Its still my go-to...
Full ReviewThe interface is very difficult to understand after it's been changed to Kakao Map. They could've just changed the logo and color scheme while retaining the old interface. Koreans always want to change. Good bye.It used to be the greatest app. Now its so terrible. The addresses are not correct. Hate it!!!!Really effed up this app. DAUM was thes best and sooo easy.. way to go kakao will be moving on.Much preferred the less garish styling of Daum Maps. Also hate the shady use of permissions, I gave it location permissions to see what it would do with them, and lo and behold, it used GPS regularly when not using the app. Sad to see that it has no English support either, I don't need it personally...
Full ReviewDo you think this apps just only for Korean? Why do you eliminate english version in Daum maps? I think the the developer never read each comment, since many users complained about this but still not changed다음지도 기능도 좋고 완전 익숙해져있었는데 회사가 바꼈다해도 소비자를 먼저 생각해야하는거아닌가요..죄다 바뀌고 뭐하나 알아보기도 힘들고 불편해요.너무 좋았는데... 카카오는 느려지고 용량도 커지고.. 아무래도 네이버로 갈아타야겠네요 ㅜㅜ 지하철 네비게이션에 이어 다음지도까지.. 카카오가 더 불편하게 바꿔놓네요제가 예전에 다음지도에서 즐겨찾기해 둔거 다 못 찾아잖아요.... 다음이랑 연결해야 되죠! 왜 카카오로 바꾸시는거에요?2016년에 초대형 인터넷 포털 업체가 만든 대표적인 앱이 가로 모드를 지원 안 하다니 정말 성의가 없네요.To make it simple, you miss too many things. Bring it back!!최고의 맵은 다음맵, 카카오 맵 분발 하세요. 네이버로 넘어 가야 하나 ㅠㅠ이런 쓰레기로 바꾼 사람은 빨리 사표쓰길 바랍니다 ^ㅗ^ 이제 네이버 지도나 써야겠네soo easy to use, more beautiful and clean design.제발 이전으로 돌려주세요Please bring back the old version😭더 깔끔해지고 편리해졌네요:)Can't click at one starting place and one ending place on the map like the daum map.Other than no English support, the app improved a lot for me. As a former heavy Google map user, it's now much easier and convenient to use (favorite places in the map, one finger zoom in and out feature etc). Quite smooth zoom in and out transition. It's too much like Google map, though...This is a good app if you can read Korean. I like the color system that it uses for the trains and subway stops. It's helpful when pairing it with Google maps for readers of English, and for readers of Korean. It has a good interface and is nice to use.As a foreigner living in korea, this update makes it harder for me to use without the small pieces of english that daum used to have. Perhaps an english update?I loved the previous version. Daum map, 다음지도 was the best thing ever. Whatever corporate reason was behind changing it......deep dissapointment.The Daum map much more easier than Kakao map...now its from better to worst...지도 대중교통 길찾기 최고 앱 "이었던" 다음맵이 카카오맵으로 업데이트되고 아쉬운점이 많다. 우선 잘 사용하던 4×1짜리 위젯(각 항목별로 버튼을 제공하던)이 삭제되어 개인적으로 아쉽다. 그리고 카카오맵의 직관적이지 않은 UI도 다음맵을 그립게 하는 이유다.다음맵에 비해 크게 좋아진 점은 없고 확대시 골목길이 흐릿하지만, 워낙 다음맵이 잘 만들어서 큰 문제 없음. 버스 정류장과 도착시간, 주소 검색이 무리없이 잘 됩니다. ―,.―다음 맵에서 카카오 맵으로 바뀌면서 디자인도 예쁘고 엄청 보기 편해졌어요! 주로 대중교통을 이용하는데 한 눈에 보기쉽게 버스 지하철 시외교통을 볼수있어 어떤 걸 타고갈지 고를수 있어요 ㅎㅎ 다른 곳 맵 보다 훨씬 정확한것 같아 쓰기 편합니다!예전 Dxx맵때보다 체감속도도 낳아진듯하고 가벼워졌다는 느낌일까요, 무엇보다 거리뷰 기능에선 여타 다른앱과 비교해봐도 가장낳은거 같아요~자주쓰던 다음지도에 비해서 많이 편리해지고 구성이 간단해진 점이 좋습니다! 특히 집이나 자주 가는 장소 추가하는 점이 맘에 들어요. 한가지 아쉬운 점은 영문 버전이 안나온 점이랍니다.. 자세한 상호와 국내스트릿뷰까지 번역되려면 시간이 좀 걸리겠죠??지도가 한결 보기 편해졌습니다. 색도 선명해지고! 다음 지도를 애용했던 유저인데, 당장은 ui가 바뀌어서 쓰기가 살짝 불편하지만 금방 적응할 수 있을 것 같아요. 다만, 지하철 노선도가 무거워진 감이 없지 않아 있네요... 지하철 노선도 움직임도 뭔가 부드럽지 않습니다.업데이트 되서 카카오지도로 이름 바뀌니 지도가 보기 편해지고 너무나 깔끔 해진 듯한 느낌 입니다훨씬 깔끔해지고 뭔가 가벼워진 느낌이네요 ㅎ 즐겨찾기 지도에 표시되는건 진짜 ㅠㅜ 앞으로의 업데이트 기대하겠습니다 ㅎ전보다 깔끔해졌습니다. 보완점이 있다면 지하철 예상 도착시간이 일반열차 기준입니다. 급행 기준 예상시간도 같이 나왔으면 좋겠네요이전 버전보다 더 업그레이드 되고 위치도 더 잘 잡는 거 같네요.이 전거가 나아요... 지하철 노선도도 안나와있고 .. 별로임DaumMap는 더 좋았어요. 버스정류장 터치할때 버스 많이 봤어요. 이제 터치 또 하기 밖에 못 봐요.It would the best app if it had English language included. It's very hard for foreigners to used.But need toblog in to use navigation? Hope that is no longer the case. Good job!원래다음맵 썼었는데 카카오맵이더편리하고좋네요정말 편리하네요 길 잃기가 힘들정도..Very useful to search for places and directions. Would be 5 star if it had English바로가기 위젯은 어디갔나요 ㅠGps를 켜면 나오는 나의 현재 위치가 원모양으로 바뀌었는데 들고 걷다보면 방향이 잘못되어서 돌아간적이 많아요. 예전 다음지도의 삼각형 모양은 내가 어느방향을 보고 걷고 있는지 알수 있어서 다른방향으로 걷는 실수가 없었는데 말입니다. 원모양의 현재위치는 애플사의 네비를 따라한것 같은데 다음지도의 삼각형이 훨씬 나았으며 실제로 매일 써보는 사람이 아니라면 개발팀에서 좀 나오기를. 책상에서 앉아만 있으니 뭐가 중헌지를 모르는듯. 그리고 애니미가 너무 많아 짜증을 유발함. 쓰다보니 마치 부엌일 한번 안해본 한남이 부엌을 디자인해서 엉망...

Full Review귀엽고 쓰기 좋은 거 같아요스카이뷰 대박입니다 👍Designs are good and added menus are convinient.카카오가 날로 번창하고 있네요. 일단 굉장히 가벼워서 좋아요. 그만큼 용량이 적게 먹힌다는 거겠지요..? (예전에 네이버 지도로 자전거 여행 며칠 하고 2GB 넘게 사용한 경험이..) 앞에서 어떤 분이 말씀하신 것처럼 대중교통과 네비를 합치면 좋겠네요. 그리고.. 네이버에서도 하지 못하고 있는 해외지도 서비스는.. 교통이나 정보는 고사하고 지형지명만이라도.. 구글이 있으니 필요없겠다 생각말고 과감하게 투자해서 지경을 넓혀보세요. 화이팅입니다~Why?Not badDaum Maps was my go-to app for many many years in Seoul. It had a reasonable amount of English and was very easy to use. This update from Kakao removed absolutely all English. Unless you are fully fluent in Korean, I would avoid this app like the plague.Really dislike the new Kakao map. Even thought I can't understand Korean, I could still use the old Daum map with the "my location" and selecting where I want to go on the map. The colors are also too bright and annoying. Please make the old version available again.Awesome update. So much better than the previous version. I like it how they try to follow the material design trend. The animation seems to be a bit heavy, though. Anyway, in my opinion, the best map app you can find in Korea.The old one worked and looked so much better. From 5/5 to 2/5. I dont want to zoom so far in to see subway stations and exit numbers. It still is better thsn Naver Map.The new face lift looks great. The integration with KakaoTalk and other social media aspects make this a great update. If you aren't afraid of change then this is for you! Complete removal of English was a bit of a downer but hey if you already know the ins and outs of general map apps then it shou...
Full ReviewIf you can speak Korean, this update is awesome with so many new features and great UI/UX. However, non Korean will not like it due to the lack of English, just like naver map1. 런쳐에 빼놨던 옛날 아이콘이 업그레이드 하면서 사라집니다. activity alias같은 것이라도 걸어놔서 예전 버젼의 호환성을 유지하는 것이 더 나았을 것 같습니다. 2. 예전버젼에서 사용하던 즐겨찾기를 가져오는 기능을 찾기가 힘듭니다. 즐겨찾기가 하나도 없을 때는, 다음지도 즐겨찾기 버튼을 눈에 띄는 곳에 배치하는게 좋을 것 같습니다.This so difficult..please let me use the old version길찾기 기능에서 실시간 버스오는 타이밍계산되는게 참 마음에 듭니다. 더하여 기존 다음맵보다 라이트한 느낌이 들면서 UI가 좋아졌어요. 앱속도도 빠른거같구요. 적극추천합니다와이파이 스캐닝(위치 정확도 향상)을 켜놓지 않으면 현재위치를 못 잡게 되어있네요. 필수도 아닌데. 넥서스 5X 안드로이드 7.0 입니다.길찾기했을때 한방에 버스, 지하철, 버스+지하철 할수있던 다음맵이 좋았음. 이건 따로 ▽버튼 눌러서 골라야하고!!! 불편함.기존 다음 네이버 맵 보다 디자인이 좋아서 다른 것은 차치하고서라도 일단 쓰고 싶네요.이전에쓰던 다음맵은 어플이 갑자기 다운되는경우가 많았는데 이건 부드럽고 해발이나 건물 높이 표시가되서 지도로 길찾기가 더욱편해진것 같네요 .!!인터페이스가 더 직관적으로 바뀌어서 쓰기 더 유용하네요! 특히 스크롤로 길찾기 경로를 따라갈 수 있어서 좋아요. 지하철과 버스를 구분하는 색깔이 다르다면 더 확인하기 쉬울 것 같아요!Hate that kakao took over!지도를 좌우로 돌렸을때 장소이름도 같이 돌아가서 보기 편하네요. 그리고 카카오내비 연동을 통해서 바로 길찾기도 되는 점도 편리합니다. 그리고 카카오 버스랑 카카오메트로와의 연동을 통해 뭔가 대중교통 길찾기도 타앱에 비해 빠른 경로로 알려주는것 같아 좋습니다.구글맵이나 티맵처럼 맵을 이동할 때 핀치 줌인/아웃과 동시에 두손가락을 움직여 무빙하는 기능이 가능했으면 좋겠습니다. 두손가락으로는 확대와 회전만 되고 무빙은 한 손가락으로만 해야 되서 불편합니다. 그나마 네이버지도보나는 작동이 부드러워 괜찮네요.old one better and easy...this one so much complicated..I hate this the older one is more useful what a trashso good! 아직 적응중이긴 하지만 곧 제것이 되겠죠^^ 앞으로 지속적으로 이용하겠습니다.우선 다음지도앱아이콘이 바탕화면에서 사라져서 당황했네요 둘째로 다음지도가 네이버지도보다 나았던점은 가독성과 한눈에 추천정보가 모두보인다는점이였는데 완전히 없어졌네요.한마디로하자면 네이버지도의 모양이나스타일을 빼다박아놨습니다. 지도란 가독성과 직관력있는 시야제공이라고봐서 다음을 이용했는데 장점을 잃었습니다 지도가 뭉개져서보여요 둘째로는 주변추천 음식점이나 스토어 보이는게 너무지져분하게 널려있습니다. 이는 구글앱을 베껴온듯하네요.. 결과적으로 기존다음지도앱 개발팀은 없어지고 지도만들어본적없는 카카오팀이 네이버와 구글을 짬뽕해서 만들어...
Full ReviewWhy daum map in not available in english version다음맵 잘 썼는데 더 좋아졌어요~ 근처 맛집 등 추천 장소가 있어서 좋네요. 그런데 영화 순위 정보는 불필요한 것 같아요. 차라리 근처 극장 정보가 유용할 듯 합니다디자인이 더 깔끔해지고, 눈에 쉽게 들어와요! bb원래 네이버를 싫어하고 다음을 좋아해서 다음 지도를 쓰다가 네이버 지도에 비해 너무 기능이 떨어져서(검색기능 부정확, 요금정보 미제공, 즐겨찾기 등록상의 불편 등) 어쩔 수 없이 네이버 지도로 갈아 탔었어요. 그런데 이번에 카카오맵으로 바뀌었다는 소식을 듣고, 카카오지하철이랑 카카오버스가 좋으니(잘 쓰고 있어요~) 이것도 좋아지지 않았을까 해서 깔아보았는데 역시 좋네요. 앞서 언급했던 네이버에 비해 부족했던 기능이 보완되고, 지도 조감도 설정도 다양하고 디자인도 더 깔끔해서 가독성이 좋습니다. 감사합니다 잘 쓸게요!The old one was betterI need update maps.편하고 깔끔하네요다음맵보다는 좀 빨라지려나....Change for the sake of change. The actual appearance of your maps is more like Naver Maps now, which is a bad thing. Also, the function of long-pressing for five options is now gone. Yes, you remain better than Google Maps, but that really isn't difficult... You guys are obsessed with stamping your ...

It says "an unknown error while installing"다 좋고 잘쓰고 있는데 축적이 없어서 대략적인 거리를 아는데 불편함How to choose English languagePerhaps not as thorough as naver maps but it is accurate for bus routes and subways.

Will be even better if navigation features are included.Not in English ! How to use ?An excellent map application for korea. The location search function has been a life saver for me.폰에 기본으로 설치되어져 있는 구글 지도 보다 다음지도 앱이 훨씬 뛰어납니다. 대한민국에서는 구글보단 다음이 갑입니다. 다음지도의 장점은, 1. 구글지도 보다 나은 지도 정확성 애플이 구글지도를 빼고 자체 지도를 넣고 얼마나 곤경에 처했는지 아실겁니다. 지도는 생명이 정확성입니다. 애플, 구글보단 다음지도가 훨~씬 정확합니다. 2. 길안내 아이나비, T map 도 써본사람을서, 자동차용 네비게이션이 아닌이상 다음 지도 앱 만한게 없다고 생각합니다. 길찾기 성능은 상용 네비게이션 못지 않습니다. 3. 다양한...

I can find that out using the kakao subway app, but it's really inefficient to go between apps. I end up using Google Maps instead because they allow you to input the time you will depart or wish to arr...
Full ReviewI had Daum Maps on my phone, and it was a great app. Why change it and replace it with that terrible thing? No language options, an indecipherable menu? Why replace something good with something absolutely crappy? I am uninstalling this.This app sucks! Here's why. Almost every time I choose a route, I see the projected cost for tolls. Yet every time it re-routes me, without asking first, and I pay 3 times more than anticipated. I can't even count how much money this dumb app has cost me. DON'T RE-ROUTE WOTHOUT MY PERMISSION!!!Kk maps find routes with public transport, with big 'gaps' (chunks of the route that isnt covered by any public transport, like 10km or any distance). However doest tell you about the gaps. How am I suppose to cover gaps? One has to walk/bike/take taxi?? Tell me!! Daum maps didnt have such flaws....Used this map during my first trip to Seoul. I really like the real-time bus information. Makes moving around more easier and accurate.Have now several times ended up going to somewhere that is closed down. It s outdated.There is no better navigation in the world. It has it all. If you live in Korea and planning get it.Dump it same where. Every thing in Chinese. No where English is used translated!I wonder if there is an option to just keep iy into english? Mine (except for the tabs) are all in Korean. I van read Hangeul but understand just a little.Great that the a itself is in english, but not good that the directions are all in Korean. I was just looking at the dot on the map to hope I was moving in the right direction.App caused a catastrophic failure of my phone while uninstalling it, what a joke.Good app. Very useful and quite accurate. There is definitely room for improvement but on the whole it served its purpose to help us find our way in Seoul and Busan.버스어플 지도앱 싹다 정리하고 카카오맵만 깔면됨 진짜 편하다 특히 버스 몇초후 도착에서 지립니다실시간 교통반영을 전혀안함. 체증으로 1시간 걸리는데 15분 도착이라고 나옴. 쓸모없음.먼저 디자인이 깔끔하기 개선된 것같습니다. 추가 오랜 사용이 필요하겠지만 아직은 이전에 비해 다른 성능개선점을 찾지는 못하였습니다.why not all play sub way it is very nice gAaaaaamëجميل التطبيق فيها كل الاماكن الكورية وتساعد لمن تطلب من التكسي يمشي على التطبيق تقدر تبحث عن مطاعم حلال في كوريا좋아요 3월 25일부터 민식이법 시행되는데 경로 중에 스쿨존 제외하는 경로좀 만들어 주세요... 아 대한민국에서 스쿨존 안지나고 갈수없나..ㅡㅡ;; 아님 조금 더 스쿨존이라는 거 강조해주시는 걸로 업데이트해주시면 좋겠습니다...I would like to see an English language setting. My husbands big car GPS has a choice of Korean or English speaking voice. I would like to see the same for this program.How all the updates are in English but not a single word of English IN the app. Good map though if you're Korean.This app is cool. very comprotable, but I particularly love yellow of kakao apps. Thank you very much this impressive map!Tried to search couple of times and easy to navigate all I need. Good info and ratingsYes really bad국내 지도 어플 중 가장 깔끔하고 직관적이네요. 주위 대중 교통 검색은 독보적입니다.다음지도 너무 잘쓰고있습니다. 하나 기능 개선 요청드립니다. 3D sky view기능에서 두손가락으로 지도를 내리면 각도조절이 되는데 90도에서 한 70도정도까지밖에 안내려가더라구요. view각도를 최대 0도 지평선까지 각도범위를 넓혀주시면 대한민국 최고 지도앱이 될거같아요. 해당 지역을 가지않아도 전망도 볼수있어서 훨씬더 유용해질거같아요.Just korean !
